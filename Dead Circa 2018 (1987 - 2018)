Dead Circa 2018 (1987 - 2018)

Though not clinically dead, 
I am certain I am already dead.

The passage of time, 
the days, the weeks and the years are but 
flatline one sees on the ICU bedside monitors.

Nothing seems to interest or excite anymore.
No P Waves, QRS, T Wave - nothing. 
No wonderment, awe or joy.

Only flatline.
