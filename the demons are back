The Demons are Back

On the knife edge between obsession - not genius - and insanity
Sometimes I wish the mind can stop giving a fuck about things
But the mind fucks you up like anything
But the mind fucks you up like anything
Frayed nerves fraying further
One is consumed by the idea
as much as the idea consumes one
Like the pendulum swings between pain and boredom
Overmastered by the idea
loop that never ends
The demons are back, with vengeance.
