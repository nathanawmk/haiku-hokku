Regrets

Like a persistent low-grade fever, 
regrets does not go away easily.

Like an albatross around your neck,
it sticks on you, 
wears you down and 
makes every day all but dazed and hazy.

Its stupefying effect is real.

These dazed, hazy days stretch into weeks, 
weeks into years,
years into decades
till one grinds to a halt. 

A life completely wasted, with regrets.
