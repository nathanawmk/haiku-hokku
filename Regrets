Regrets

Like a persistent low-grade fever, 
regrets does not quite go away.

It sticks with you, 
wears you down and 
makes every day all but hazy.

Its stupefying effect is real.

These dazed, hazy days stretch into weeks, 
weeks into years,
years into decades. 

A life completely wasted, with regrets.
