Fear in the time of the Wuhan Coronavirus (WIP)

Fear, 
though cannot be seen, 
is clearly manifested. 

shelves with no food,
streets with no vehicles,
restaurants with no people,
church without congregation

faces full of unease
minds filled with repeated what-ifs
hearts racing to the edge of the abyss
