they say you've made your bed you lie in it
that is bull I say
some are born into bed of roses
some are born into bed of thorns
some lead charmed lives
while some lead hard lives 
mostly through no choice of theirs
inequality is a gordian knot that defies simplistic explanation
for one, my Jesus did not make the crib he was born into
the challenge (for me) is how to unfuck the already fucked
