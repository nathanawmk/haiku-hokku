To my wife, Jasmine

My best friend.

Delicate and sweet as the flower itself
Met at Pullman Hotel Kuching during church retreat
Then love at first sight - somewhat 

First date at the restaurant Relish
You wore a blue top and black shorts
Relishing first date it was for me. 

Second date at Gelare
We poured out our hearts
You shared "You Are Special By Max Lucado"
To home we went and cried.
 
First held our hands at the makeshift orange white stripes bus stop outside newton mrt (downtown exit)
Though the bus stop no longer exists,
our journey of love has just begun.

On the way back to Hume,
you rested your head on my shoulder
and I rested my head on your head.

Perhaps this is how love should be -- rested in each other. 

Looking back,
God must have intended for us to be together.
we met in such an opportune time and place.

Contented to contend with this short life here with you, my love - Jasmine.
