Ecce Homo! The modern insignificant man.

By the time the insignificant man passes on, 
he has spent ~5000 days working, 
sent out ~250,000 emails, 
breathe ~1.3 million cubic metre of air, 
generated ~63,000kg of waste. 

Perhaps the insignificant man is the waste.
His life is anything but insignificant, if not downright pointless.
The insignificant man does not want to be insignificant -- no one ever sets out to be insignificant. But yet.
Perhaps Significance is not measured through what the insignificant man has done but imputed -- through Christ
