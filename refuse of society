Refuse of society

In the society of elites and aristocrats, 
the rules of the game are set by them.

the elites define what is valuable,
the aristocrats define what is worthless
above all, they seek to perpetuate the status quo for self-seeking purposes.

Everyone else who does not fit their criteria are considered the refuse of society
How does the elites deal with these refuse? The elites bag them like scums. 

But history is instructive. 

Like how Goliath looked at David with digust,
the aristocrats heap heaps of scorn on the refuse. 
However, Scrappy David ultimately prevailed against Goliath.

Scrappy David beat Goliath at its own game.
