Refuse of society

In the society of elites and aristocrats, 
where rules of the game are defined by them.

they define what is valuable
they define what is worthless
above all, they seek to perpetuate the status quo for their own advantage.

Everyone else who does not fit their criteria are considered the refuse of society.
What do you with these refuse? The elites bag them.
