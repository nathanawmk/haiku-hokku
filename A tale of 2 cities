A tale of 2 cities - Hong Kong and Singapore
Both British Colonies
Former is messy, dynamic and free
The latter is tidy, stale and controlled
One has black-clad masked demonstrators
Another has politicians decked in white
But these differences no longer matter: both are on a slow but sure decline
-- Nathan Aw, 32, Singapore
