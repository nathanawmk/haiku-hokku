The Midlife Malaise

Malaise that does not go away.
The onset of malaise begins with the lack of lack.
Condition is made worse with distractions, decadence and comforts. 

rudderless
a day,
a month,
a year,
soon a decade. 

Perhaps it is decadence
Perhaps it is timidity
Perhaps it is loss aversion. 

After awhile, nothing seems to matters
Some call it depression,
I call it malaise
