Time flows linearly, unforgivably 

At the hallways of the hospital,
time flows linearly, unforgivably.

The gruelling wait for lab results,
and the cruel contradictions that one needs to confront. 

Between the dwindling amount of time left on earth
and the wait for lab results lies the present. 

Which do you choose?
