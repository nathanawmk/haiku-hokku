Time flows linearly, unforgivably 

At the hallways of the hospital,
time flows linearly, unforgivably.

The gruelling wait for lab results,
the cruel contradictions that one needs to confront. 

Between the dwindling amount of time left on earth
and the gruelling wait for lab results 
lies the present, the gift. 

What a double whammy!
What a double bind!

Nathan Aw, 32, Singapore
