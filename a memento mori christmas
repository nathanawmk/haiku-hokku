A memento mori christmas

Never knew why christmas was merry
Nor why new year 
was happy
These prefixes are alien to me. 
Mortality, however, is familar to me. 
With every passing christmas and new year, nearer, my God, to thee!
Wishing you a merry, no, not merry, but a memento mori christmas and a happy, no, not happy, but a heavenward new year.

Nathan Aw, 32, Singapore
