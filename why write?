To be alive is to create!
For this reason I write...
To be fully present and alive
--Nathan Aw, 32, Singapore

Words have a longevity 
that fleeting human lives 
simply do not have 
and will ever have
--Nathan Aw, 32, Singapore

Measuring the distance between the diammetrically opposed,
Exploring the antithesis,
Describing the juxtaposition,
Bridging the chasm,
This is what and why I write
--Nathan Aw, 32, Singapore
